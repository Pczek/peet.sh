title: "Why an Ebook Reader Works for Me"
---

I love the smell of books. I love the feel of books. I guess a lot of people have this in common. I love my magazines, my fresh prints, and typography but why did I start preferring reading on an Ebook reader?

Thinking about it in more depth, I realize, that being a software engineer I read all the time on a digital display already. I’m never been used to reading printed books. Even in school we just read a couple of books and I hated it. The stated smell and touch I love are misleading. This has nothing to do with actually reading a printed book.

While investigating the pros of an ebook reader the more I realize how I hate printed books. The following points sound nit-picky, but in sum, they keep me from reading more books.

Books tend to weigh a lot. Have you ever helped a friend move flats? What has been the heaviest box?

Books come in unhandy sizes. Why does the size of a book vary in the first place? Small, big, more or less squared. It’s weird and often more a pain than a benefit. How did the shape of a book ever improve its content?

Books have custom typography. When I’m speaking of books, I’m talking about the classic library book. Mostly text from start till finish. Books vary in the font they use. Big, small, different serif fonts, varying line spacings, and if fancy some minor artist flavor for the chapter headings. Weirdly enough the difference for me is too minor to make a lasting difference and big enough to annoy me. Now and then the spacing is too wide or too narrow, the paper too thin or thick.

Books need a light source. Reading in bed sucks if you don’t have a proper light for reading. Bedside lamps for me only lighten one page, while the other is in the dark from the rest of the book. It takes some active effort handling the book to get some light on the darkened page.

To conclude, in my opinion, books are heavy, oddly shaped, vary in presentation without benefit, and require handling an external light source.

These are the main points I was able to solve by having an ebook reader. The reader has a constant weight and format. The presentation is adjustable and consistent. It brings its light source.

The following points I consider an unexpected bonus. I can read blog articles on it easily as well, same presentation, same experience, away from a “screen”.

It’s possible to obtain a free or preview version of a book. So I start reading a book and without pressure skip it if I don’t find it worthwhile. (I tend to force myself through a book if committed effort and money to get it)

Using an ebook reader exclusively for 6 months now, I’m quite happy with it and don’t see any drawbacks. Still a big fan of coffee table, well-illustrated books but they don’t clash with the book I want to read on my ebook reader anyways. Of course, it’s not beneficial for local businesses and the tradition of book shops and libraries but as I’m reading more books than ever the personal benefit outweighs this societal drawback.
